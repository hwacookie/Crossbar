/**
 * The `BackendAdapter` contract — Crossbar's single most important interface and the FROZEN boundary
 * every backend implementation codes against. Phase 2 fan-out (one adapter per backend) targets this
 * file and nothing else; the conformance suite (tests/conformance) validates every adapter against it.
 *
 * Design tenets:
 *  - Adapters are STATELESS. All state (selected server, credentials, last-known models) is owned by
 *    the registry and passed in. An adapter instance is a singleton describing one backend *kind*.
 *  - Adapters perform NO direct I/O. Every network call goes through the injected {@link Probe}, so the
 *    same adapter runs unchanged in production, in discovery, and against test fixtures.
 *  - Capabilities are HONEST. An optional method is present iff the matching {@link Capability} is in
 *    `capabilities`. The orchestrator checks the set, never feature-sniffs the method.
 *  - Pi mapping is OWNED by the adapter. `toPiModel` / `inferenceBaseUrl` are the only places that know
 *    which built-in Pi API type and compat flags a backend needs; the shim stays generic.
 *
 * See ARCHITECTURE.md for how the registry, discovery engine, and provider shim consume this.
